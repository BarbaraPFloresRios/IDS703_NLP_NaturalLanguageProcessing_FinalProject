#### Objective

The objective of this study is to classify documents, distinguishing between the Bible and Hamlet, two emblematic literary works with markedly different styles and themes. To achieve this, we will employ a generative method like Naive Bayes and a discriminative method such as a Neural Network. Our aim is to identify the distinctive patterns that characterize these works, ultimately developing a robust classifier capable of discerning the subtle differences defining the essence of the Bible and the poetic expression of Hamlet. In exploring textual crossroads, we aspire to not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities that set apart these two timeless literary influences but also to comprehend the differences between these two methods of generative and discriminative classification.
