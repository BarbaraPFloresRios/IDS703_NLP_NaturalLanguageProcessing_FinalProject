#### Introduction

In this project, we will delve into document classification through various strategies. Our focus is specifically on identifying whether a document belongs to an original work by Jane Austen or if it is a fanfiction based on the author's works. Our strategies to address the problem were developed as follows:


#### Naive Bayes Approach: Exploring Document Classification Through Generative Probabilistic Modeling

In this initial stage, we will delve into the utilization of a generative probabilistic model, specifically, the Naive Bayes algorithm, to carry out this classification task. We will explore how this algorithm can effectively discern between the distinctive features of Jane Austen's original works and the creative interpretations found in fan fiction. The code developed to implement this model is located in the [naive_bayes_classifier.py](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing_FinalProject/blob/main/naive_bayes_classifier.py) file.
